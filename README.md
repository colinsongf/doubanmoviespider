# Douban Movie Spider

Use scrapy to download movie info from douban movie

this tool is still under development, so bellowing instructions may be changed over time.

## Ideas
A common problem in spider is the spider has been shut down, and you need to restart the spider but you don't want the spider to re-crawl the website, so how to resume your spider is important.

One of the nice feature of douban movie is each movie has a unique id, so my basic idea is like this:

1. DoubanIdListSpider use tag to crawl movie ids, get a collection(movie_id_list) of movie ids. Each item contains id, url, if this movie has crawled, how many attempt times.

2. DoubanListSpider contain a bit array(100000000 elements) and initialize this bit array with movie_id_list to mark the downloaded movie ids. Get the un-crawled movie ids and start to crawl, and update the movie_id_list.

3. How to crawl by using serval machines?
   - use a remote mongodb to store movie_id_list, and each machine download it, and crawl part of it, after download, upadte the remote colletion

## How to use

- Create a mongodb database movie
- Run cmd in linux: scrapyq crawl doubanidlist --logfile = [logfilename] -s JOBDIR=[resume dir]
- If you restart the id list spider, change the setting FromDatabase to True(not done yet)
- Use doubanlist spider to crawl movie detail informations
